  Enunciado:
    When the link having a class buy is clicked, an array called products, containing a list of all pro-
    ducts and their quantities, should be sent in an Ajax POST request to the address calculatetotal.php.

    When the result of that request is received, the text of the paragraph total should be replaced
    by the received result (or by not enough stock if the received result is less than 0).
    Example of the array to be sent:
    [{"name":"Apple","qty":3},{"name":"Banana","qty":5},{"name":"Pear","qty":6}]

  Resolução:
    let req = new XMLHttpRequest();
    req.onreadystatechange = function() {
      if (req.readyState == 4) {
        let stockNum = req.responseText;
        let p = document.getElementsByClassName("total")[0];
        p.innerHTML = stockNum < 0 ? "not enough stock" : stockNum;
      }
    };

    req.open("post", "calculatetotal.php", true);
    req.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");
    req.send(encodeForAjax()); // TODO

    document.getElementsByClassName("total")
